---

## CRITICAL REVIEW PRIORITIES

### Always Check These Three Items First:

| Priority | What to Check | Action if Missing |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **1. ID Verification** | Clear, readable state ID or driver's license | "Please upload a clear photo of your state ID or driver's license" |
| **2. Medical Records** | Actual medical documentation (not just medication bottles) | "Please provide medical records from your doctor documenting your diagnosis" |
| **3. Diagnosis Match** | Patient intake matches medical record diagnosis | "Please clarify - your intake says X but records show Y" |

### Remember:
- **Photos of medical records ARE acceptable** - provider info doesn't need to be perfectly visible as long as diagnosis and limitations are clear
- **Medication bottles alone are NEVER sufficient** - always require proper medical documentation
- **ID must be clear enough to read** - name must match medical records

## SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR WALKING LIMITATIONS

### Medical Records Required for Severe Walking Limitations

| Condition Type | Required Documentation | Specific Elements Needed |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Arthritic Conditions** | X-rays or imaging showing joint damage | Maximum walking distance (e.g., "less than 200 feet") |
| | Rheumatologist or orthopedist evaluation | Time limitations (e.g., "cannot stand >5 minutes") |
| | Functional capacity assessment | Use of assistive devices |
| | Description of walking distance limitations | Impact on activities of daily living |
| | Failed conservative treatments | Progression of condition over time |
| **Neurological Conditions** | Neurologist evaluation with specific diagnosis | Maximum walking distance |
| | EMG/nerve conduction studies if applicable | Time limitations for standing/walking |
| | Gait assessment documentation | Assistive device requirements |
| | Balance test results | Impact on daily activities |
| | Description of assistive device requirements | Disease progression documentation |
| **Orthopedic Conditions** | Orthopedic surgeon or specialist evaluation | Specific walking distance before symptoms |
| | Imaging results (MRI, CT, X-ray) | Standing tolerance |
| | Surgical history if applicable | Pain scale ratings with ambulation |
| | Physical therapy notes documenting limitations | Functional limitations in daily life |
| | Specific walking distance before onset | Treatment history and response |

---

## MEDICAL RECORD VERIFICATION PROCESS

### Primary Review Requirements

| Verification Step | Action Required | Decision |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| **1. Diagnosis Match** | Compare patient intake form diagnosis with medical records | If match + qualifying condition → Proceed |
| | | If no match → Request clarification |
| **2. ID Verification** | **Required:** Clear state ID or driver's license uploaded | If clear ID present → Proceed |
| | **Check for:** Name matches medical records, ID is readable, not expired | If missing/unclear → Request clear ID upload |
| **3. Documentation Type** | **Acceptable:** Medical records with diagnosis, X-rays with interpretation, specialist reports | Mark for physician review |
| | **NOT Acceptable:** Medication bottles alone, pharmacy printouts, self-written statements | Request medical records |
| **4. Walking Limitation** | Look for documentation of inability to walk 200 feet | If documented → Approve for review |
| | | If not documented → Request additional documentation |

### Documentation Decision Matrix

| What Patient Provided | Administrative Action | Sample Response |
|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Medical records with matching diagnosis | Verify diagnosis matches intake + state qualification | "Records sufficient for physician review" |
| X-rays with radiologist report | Accept if shows qualifying condition | "X-ray documentation accepted for physician review" |
| Only medication bottles | **INSUFFICIENT** | "Please provide medical records from your doctor documenting your diagnosis and walking limitations" |
| No documentation uploaded | **INSUFFICIENT** | "Medical records required to substantiate your limitation to walk 200 feet. Please upload records from your treating physician." |
| Records without walking limitation info | Request additional documentation | "Please provide documentation from your physician describing your specific walking limitations" |
| No ID or unclear ID uploaded | **INSUFFICIENT** | "Please upload a clear photo of your state ID or driver's license for verification" |
| ID doesn't match medical records | Request clarification | "The name on your ID doesn't match your medical records. Please provide matching documentation or explanation" |

### Key Requirements
- **Clear state ID or driver's license** must be uploaded for verification
- **Diagnosis must match** between patient intake and medical records
- **Walking limitation** (inability to walk 200 feet) must be substantiated
- **Medication bottles alone are never sufficient** - always request proper medical records
- **X-rays are acceptable** if they include interpretation/report confirming qualifying condition

## ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM REMINDERS

| Key Principle | Application | Rationale |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Always verify ID first | Check for clear, readable state ID or driver's license | Required for all applications |
| When in doubt, request documentation | Better to have complete records | Saves physician time and improves approval rates |
| Be specific in requests | Tell patients exactly what's needed | Reduces back-and-forth communication |
| Consider combination of conditions | Multiple minor issues may qualify together | Holistic view of patient mobility |
| Document your decision | Note why additional paperwork was/wasn't requested | Quality control and training purposes |
| Check state-specific pregnancy laws | Only FL and IL allow pregnancy alone | Avoid rejecting valid applications in these states |
| Escalate complex cases | Some situations require supervisor review | Ensures consistency in difficult cases |
| Remember physician has final say | Admin review is preliminary only | Physician makes medical determination |
